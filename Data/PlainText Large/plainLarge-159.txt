==== SiLU ====

The SiLU (Sigmoid Linear Unit) or swish function is another smooth approximation first coined in the GELU paper. 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        x
        ⋅
        sigmoid
        ⁡
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)=x\cdot \operatorname {sigmoid} (x)}
  
where 
  
    
      
        sigmoid
        ⁡
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {sigmoid} (x)}
   is the sigmoid function.


==== Softplus ====
A smooth approximation to the rectifier is the analytic function

  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        ln
        ⁡
        (
        1
        +
        
          e
          
            x
          
        
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)=\ln(1+e^{x}),}
  which is called the softplus or SmoothReLU function.  For large negative
