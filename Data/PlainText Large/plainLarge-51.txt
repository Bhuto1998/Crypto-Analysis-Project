a softmax activation function, a generalization of the logistic function, on the output layer of the neural network (or a softmax component in a component-based network) for categorical target variables, the outputs can be interpreted as posterior probabilities. This is useful in classification as it gives a certainty measure on classifications.
The softmax activation function is:

  
    
      
        
          y
          
            i
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              e
              
                
                  x
                  
                    i
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                âˆ‘
                
                  j
                  =
                  1
                
                
                  c
                
              
              
                e
                
                  
                    x
