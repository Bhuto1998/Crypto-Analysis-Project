== Strong dilution ==
When the dilution is strong, the finite fraction of removed connections (the weights) is large, giving rise to a huge uncertainty.


== Dropout ==
Dropout is a special case of the previous weight equation (3), where the aforementioned equation is adjusted to remove a whole row in the vector matrix, and not only random weights
