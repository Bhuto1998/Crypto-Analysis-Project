    {\displaystyle a\geq 0}
   is a constraint.
The ELU can be viewed as a smoothed version of a shifted ReLU (SReLU), which has the form 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        max
        (
        −
        a
        ,
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)=\max(-a,x)}
   given the same interpretation of 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
  .

The mish function could also be used as a smooth approximation of the rectifier. It is defined as 

  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        x
        tanh
        ⁡
        (
        softplus
        ⁡
        (
        x
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)=x\tanh(\operatorname {softplus} (x))}
  where 
  
    
      
        tanh
        ⁡
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tanh(x)}
   is the hyperbolic tangent and
