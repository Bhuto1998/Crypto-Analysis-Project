n 1982, he applied Linnainmaa's AD method to neural networks in the way that became widely used.The development of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) very-large-scale integration (VLSI), in the form of complementary MOS (CMOS) technology, enabled increasing MOS transistor counts in digital electronics. This provided more processing power for the development of practical artificial neural networks in the 1980s.In 1986 Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams showed that backpropagation  learned interesting internal representations of words as feature vectors when trained to predict the next word in a sequence.From 1988 onward, the use of neural networks transformed the field of protein structure prediction, in particular when the first cascading networks were trained on profiles (matrices) produced by multiple sequence alignments.In 1992, max-pooling was introduced to help with least-shift invariance and tolerance to deformation to aid 3D object recognition. Schmidhuber adopted a multi-level hierarchy of networks (1992) pr
