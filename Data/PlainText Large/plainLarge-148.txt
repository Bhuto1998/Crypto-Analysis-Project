ely used in statistical modeling. The logistic function is one of the family of functions called sigmoid functions because their S-shaped graphs resemble the final-letter lower case of the Greek letter Sigma. It has a continuous derivative, which allows it to be used in backpropagation. This function is also preferred because its derivative is easily calculated:

  
    
      
        
          f
          ′
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        f
        (
        x
        )
        (
        1
        −
        f
        (
        x
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f'(x)=f(x)(1-f(x))}
  .(The fact that 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   satisfies the differential equation above can easily be shown by applying the chain rule.)
If single-layer neural network activation function is modulo 1, then this network can solve XOR problem with a single neuron.

  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        x
