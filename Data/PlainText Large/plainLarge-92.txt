e final model based on a sub-part of the dataset set apart at the start, often called a test-set. Other times methods such as k-fold cross-validation are applied. Other strategies include using conformal prediction.


== Regularization methods ==

Regularization is a process of introducing additional information to solve an ill-posed problem or to prevent overfitting. CNNs use various types of regularization.

==== Dropout ====
Because a fully connected layer occupies most of the parameters, it is prone to overfitting. One method to reduce overfitting is dropout. At each training stage, individual nodes are either "dropped out" of the net (ignored) with probability
