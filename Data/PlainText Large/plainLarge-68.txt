and Waibel introduced a variant which performs a two dimensional convolution. Since these TDNNs operated on spectrograms, the resulting phoneme recognition system was invariant to both shifts in time and in frequency. This inspired translation invariance in image processing with CNNs. The tiling of neuron outputs can cover timed stages.TDNNs now achieve the best performance in far distance speech recognition.


==== Max pooling ====
In 1990 Yamaguchi et al. introduced the concept of max pooling, which is a fixed filtering operation that calculates and propagates the maximum value of a given region. They did so by combining TDNNs with max pooling in order to realize a speaker independent isolated word recognition system. In their system they used several TDNNs per word, one for each syllable. The results of each TDNN over the input signal were combined using max pooling and the outputs of the pooling layers were then passed on to networks performing the actual word classification.
