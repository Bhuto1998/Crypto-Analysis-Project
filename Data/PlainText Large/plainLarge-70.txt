Similarly, a shift invariant neural network was proposed by W. Zhang et al. for image character recognition in 1988. The architecture and training algorithm were modified in 1991 and applied for medical image processing and automatic detection of breast cancer in mammograms.A different convolution-based design was proposed in 1988 for application to decomposition of one-dimensional electromyography convolved signals via de-convolution. This design was modified in 1989 to other de-convolution-based designs.


=== Neural abstraction pyramid ===

The feed-forward architecture of convolutional neural networks was extended in the neural abstraction pyramid by lateral and feedback connections. The resulting recurrent convolutional network allows for the flexible incorporation of contextual information to iteratively resolve local ambiguities. In contrast to previous models, image-like outputs at the highest resolution were generated, e.g., for semantic segmentation, image reconstruction, and object localizati
