egion of visual space within which visual stimuli affect the firing of a single neuron is known as its receptive field. Neighboring cells have similar and overlapping receptive fields. Receptive field size and location varies systematically across the cortex to form a complete map of visual space. The cortex in each hemisphere represents the contralateral visual field.Their 1968 paper identified two basic visual cell types in the brain:
simple cells, whose output is maximized by straight edges having particular orientations within their receptive field
complex cells, which have larger receptive fields, whose output is insensitive to the exact position of the edges in the field.Hubel and Wiesel also proposed a cascading model of these two types of cells for use in pattern recognition tasks.


=== Neocognitron, origin of the CNN architecture ===
The "neocognitron" was introduced by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1980.
It was inspired by the above-mentioned work of Hubel and Wiesel. The neocognitron introduced the two ba
