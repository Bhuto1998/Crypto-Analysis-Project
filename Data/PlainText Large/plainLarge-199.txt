ta (x,z)\leq \delta (x,y)+\delta (y,z)}
  In particular, the triplet loss algorithm is often defined with squared Euclidean (which unlike Euclidean, does not have triangle inequality) distance at its core.


=== Predefined metrics, Euclidean distance metric ===
The common learning goal is to minimize a distance metric for similar objects and maximize for distinct ones. This gives a loss function like
