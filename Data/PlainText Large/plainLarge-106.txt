o compose smaller, spatially proximate features into larger, complex structures, AtomNet discovers chemical features, such as aromaticity, sp3 carbons, and hydrogen bonding. Subsequently, AtomNet was used to predict novel candidate biomolecules for multiple disease targets, most notably treatments for the Ebola virus and multiple sclerosis.


=== Health risk assessment and biomarkers of aging discovery ===
CNNs can be naturally tailored to analyze a sufficiently large collection of time series data representing one-week-long human physical activity streams augmented by the rich clinical data (including the death register, as provided by, e.g., the NHANES study). A simple CNN was combined with Cox-Gompertz proportional hazards model and used to produce a proof-of-concept example of digital biomarkers of aging in the form of all-causes-mortality predictor.


=== Checkers game ===
CNNs have been used in the game of checkers. From 1999 to 2001, Fogel and Chellapilla published papers showing how a convolutional ne
