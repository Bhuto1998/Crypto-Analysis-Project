Rate coding converts pixel intensity into a spike train where the number of spikes is proportional to the pixel intensity.
Direct coding uses a trainable layer to generate float value for each time-step. We have a learnable layer which converts each pixel at certain time step in float number and then threshold is used on the generated floating numbers to see if they will be 1 or 0.
Phase coding encodes temporal information into spike patterns based on a global oscillator.
Burst coding transmits the burst of spikes in a small-time duration, increasing the reliability of synaptic communication between neurons.Currently there are two classification data sets  for SNNs to be used as a reference for future performance comparisons of spiking neural networks. So far MNIST data transformed into spikes has been used, but it had designer choices which werenâ€™t universally agreed on. For rate based encoding networks, MNIST can be used, but the capabilities of SNN go beyond rate encoding.  

The first data set is cal
