onvolutional networks, attractor networks, echo-state networks, deep networks, and sensor fusion networks are a few of the possibilities.
Loihi is a 14-nm Intel chip that offers 128 cores and 130,000 neurons on a 60-mm package. It integrates a wide range of features, such as hierarchical connectivity, dendritic compartments, synaptic delays and programmable synaptic learning rules. Running a spiking convolutional form of the Locally Competitive Algorithm, Loihi can solve LASSO optimization problems with over three orders of magnitude superior energy-delay product compared to conventional solvers running on a CPU isoprocess/voltage/area. A 64 Loihi research system offers 8-million-neuron neuromorphic system. Loihi is about 1,000 times as fast as a CPU and 10,000 times as energy efficient.
BrainScaleS is based on physical emulations of neuron, synapse and plasticity models with digital connectivity, running up to ten thousand times faster than real time. It was developed by the European Human Brain Project. The
