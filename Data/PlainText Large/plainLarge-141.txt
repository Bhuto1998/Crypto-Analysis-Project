 most common global optimization method for training RNNs is genetic algorithms, especially in unstructured networks.Initially, the genetic algorithm is encoded with the neural network weights in a predefined manner where one gene in the chromosome represents one weight link. The whole network is represented as a single chromosome. The fitness function is evaluated as follows:

Each weight encoded in the chromosome is assigned to the respective weight link of the network.
The training set is presented to the network which propagates the input signals forward.
The mean-squared-error is returned to the fitness function.
This function drives the genetic selection process.Many chromosomes make up the population; therefore, many different neural networks are evolved until a stopping criterion is satisfied. A common stopping scheme is: 

When the neural network has learnt a certain percentage of the training data or
When the minimum value of the mean-squared-error is satisfied or
When the maximum number of training
