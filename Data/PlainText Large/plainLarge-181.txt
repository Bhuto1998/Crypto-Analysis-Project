at consumes only 70 milliwatts; most processors in personal computers contain about 1.4 billion transistors and require 35 watts or more. IBM refers to the design principle behind TrueNorth as neuromorphic computing. Its primary purpose is pattern recognition. While critics say the chip isn't powerful enough, its supporters point out that this is only the first generation, and the capabilities of improved iterations will become clear. (IBM)
Dynamic Neuromorphic Asynchronous Processor (DYNAP) combines slow, low-power, inhomogeneous sub-threshold analog circuits, and fast programmable digital circuits. It supports reconfigurable, general-purpose, real-time neural networks of spiking neurons. This allows the implementation of real-time spike-based neural processing architectures in which memory and computation are co-localized. It solves the von Neumann bottleneck problem and enables real-time multiplexed communication of spiking events for realising massive networks. Recurrent networks, feed-forward networks, c
