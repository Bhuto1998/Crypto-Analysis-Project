led  The Heidelberg Spiking Dataset. The HD dataset consists of approximately 10k high-quality recordings of spoken digits ranging from zero to nine in English and German language. In total 12 speakers were included, six of which were female and six male. The speaker ages ranged from 21yr to 56yr with a mean of 29yr. Recorded around 40 digit sequences for each language with a total digit count of 10 420. The digits were acquired in sequences of ten successive digits. Recordings were performed in a sound-shielded room at the Heidelberg University Hospital with three microphones. Digitized by a Steinberg MR816 CSX audio interface, recordings were made in WAVE format with a sample rate of 48 kHz and 24 bit precision.  To separate the data into training and test sets,  two speakers were held out exclusively for the test set. The remainder of the test set was filled with samples (5% of the trials) from speakers also present in the training set. This division allows one to assess a trained networkâ€™s ability to gene
