In vector notation this can be written as

where the function 
  
    
      
        g
        ⁡
        (
        ⋅
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {g} (\cdot )}
   imposes the previous dilution.
In weak dilution only a small and fixed fraction of the weights are diluted. When the number of terms in the sum goes to infinite (the weights for each node) it is still infinite (the fraction is fixed), thus mean field theory can be applied. In the notation from Hertz et al. this would be written as

  
    
      
        
          ⟨
          
            h
            
              i
            
          
          ⟩
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left\langle h_{i}\right\rangle }
   the mean field temperature

  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   – a scaling factor for the temperature from the probability of keeping the weight
