== Twin networks for object tracking ==
Twin networks have been used in object tracking because of its unique two tandem inputs and similarity measurement. In object tracking, one input of the twin network is user pre-selected exemplar image, the other input is a larger search image, which twin network's job is to locate exemplar inside of search image. By measuring th
